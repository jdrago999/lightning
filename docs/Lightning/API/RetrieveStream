==  Retrieve the stream (aka timeline or feed) ==

=== Purpose ===

To retrieve the stream for a set of GUIDs/services.

=== Endpoint ===

{{{GET /stream/<type>}}}

=== Inputs ===

* guid - the authorizations. This can be specified multiple times and must be specified at least once.
* <type> - <type> can optionally be supplied in the URL (ex: stream/friends) to filter the type of events returned. (Currently supported stream types are: "friends" and "photos_uploaded")
* service - service name(s). This can be specified multiple times or zero times. If unspecified, then the service(s) for the GUIDs will be used. If specified, can be used to limit the services from the GUIDs.
* num - the number of entries to return. This defaults to 10.
* timestamp - a UNIX timestamp used to anchor the request. This defaults to now.
* forward - the direction to read the stream. Forward is forwards in time. Backwards is not. This defaults to 0 (backwards).
* echo - Whether or not to include echo (non-authorization user-generated data). This defaults to 1 (yes, include everything).

=== Outputs ===

* 200: Ok - Returns a body of the form:
{{{
{
    'data': [
        {
          <Feed object>
        }
    ]
}
}}}
